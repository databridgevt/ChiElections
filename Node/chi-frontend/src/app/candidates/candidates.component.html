                    Harold Lee Washington (April 15, 1922 – November 25, 1987)
                    was an American lawyer and politician who was the 51st
                    Mayor of Chicago. Washington became the first African
                    American to be elected as the city's mayor in February 1983.
                    He served as mayor from April 29, 1983 until his death on
                    November 25, 1987. Earlier, he was a member of the U.S.
                    House of Representatives from 1981 to 1983, representing
                    Illinois's first district. Washington had previously served
                    in the Illinois State Senate and the Illinois House of
                    Representatives from 1965 until 1976.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Washington was born in Chicago, and raised in the

                    University and Northwestern University School of Law, he
                    became involved in local 3rd Ward politics under future

                    Boone was born near Lexington, Kentucky, the seventh son of
                    Squire and Anna Grubbs Boone. Squire Boone, Sr. was Daniel
                    Boone’s father and Levi Boone’s great-grandfather, making
                    Levi Boone Daniel Boone's great-nephew. Young Levi lost his
                    father at the age of 9 when Squire finally succumbed to
                    wounds he suffered at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

                    Despite the poverty the family was plunged into by the death
                    of Squire Boone, Levi graduated from the medical school of
                    Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 1829 at
                    the age of 21. He moved to Illinois and eventually
                    established a practice in Hillsboro. In 1832, he served in
                    the Black Hawk War, first in the cavalry and then as a
                    surgeon. In 1833, Dr. Boone married Louise M. Smith,
                    daughter of Theophilus W. Smith, Justice of the Illinois
                    Supreme Court, with whom he had 11 children.

                    Edward Joseph Kelly (May 1, 1876 – October 20, 1950) was an
                    American politician who served as the 46th Mayor of Chicago
                    from April 17, 1933 until April 15, 1947.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to being mayor of Chicago, Kelly served as chief
                    engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District during the 1920s.

                    In March 1924, Kelly became president of the South Park
                    Commission. Upon his election he declared the end to an era
                    of "Deenen Republicans", a faction of South Side Republicans
                    allied with Robert R. McCormick which had lost control of
                    the South Park Commission in the March 1924 municipal
                    elections.
